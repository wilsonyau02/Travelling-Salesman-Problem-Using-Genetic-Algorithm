^These are the dataset used in assginment. burma14.tsp is for testing purpose when first time running the program so you wont run too long time on another larger datasets and at the end find that cannot run.

Please me reminded to change the dataset pathname in the program.

For MPI, please include the absolute path name e.g. "C:\\Users\user\..." instead of relative pathname.
